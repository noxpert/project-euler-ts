// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
// By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
// find the sum of the even-valued terms.
let value1: number = 0;
let value2: number = 1;
let fibonacci: number = 0;
let problem02_sum: number = 0;

while (value1 + value2 < 4000000) {
    fibonacci = value1 + value2;
    value1 = value2;
    value2 = fibonacci;
    if (fibonacci % 2 === 0) {
        problem02_sum += fibonacci;
    }
}
console.log(problem02_sum);
